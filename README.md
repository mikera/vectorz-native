## Vectorz-Native

Fast native-optimised linear algebra libray for Java

# Rationale

Vectorz provides high performance vector and matrix computations in pure-JVM code.

Vectorz-Native provides extended versions of Vectorz matrix and vector objects that implement key operations using BLAS.

So now you can have the best of both worlds: high performance JVM code with the option to switch to BLAS when you really need it.
